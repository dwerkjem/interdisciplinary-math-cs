\section{Introduction}

Algorithms are a fundamental concept in computer science. They are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Algorithms are used to manipulate data, process information, and perform computations. In computer science, algorithms are essential for writing programs, developing software, and designing systems. They are used to solve a wide range of problems, from simple arithmetic calculations to complex data analysis.

In mathematics, algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems, prove theorems, and analyze functions. They are used to calculate values, generate sequences, and test conjectures. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between algorithms and mathematics, focusing on the ways in which algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems and the connections between algorithmic complexity and mathematical complexity.

\section{Algorithmic Complexity}

Algorithmic complexity is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm. It is used to analyze the performance of algorithms and compare their efficiency. Algorithmic complexity is typically measured in terms of time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity is a measure of the time required for an algorithm to run, while space complexity is a measure of the memory required by an algorithm.
